Hi ${PERSON_NAME}. This is a test of the LCAM daily email reporting system.

There are still a number of things to implement here. Including, but not limited to...

1. Clear sky hours is intended to just be an ascii representation of when the sky was clear. Something like - 10 oooxxxxxxx - would mean that there were 3 clear sky hours at the start of the night out of a total of 10 hours of darkness.
2. Number of detections is only reporting for camera #1. I need to implement a monitor to run the email script only after all cameras have finished processing.
3. Number of meteors / satellites has not been implemented. This will likely be based on number of correlations against TLEs for satellites and # of detections minus # of satellites for meteors.
4. The NTP line does not seem to work when running this script under screen. I'm not sure why.
5. The list of satellites and meteors is in progress. There should already be an attachment of the list of all detections.
